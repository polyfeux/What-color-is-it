# What color is it?
A simple animation in HTML/JS assigning each second the background-color a specific color of the RGB color space.

In combination with [HTML Screensaver](http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/djmclean/htmlscreensaver.html) you can use these web pages as a screensaver.
Unfortunately HTML Screensaver doesn't support the smooth color transition of CSS3.
